******Compile the code*********************
*******************************************

First: compile the code
 - need to compile all files: 
 	 hotokezaka.cpp Linear_interpol/linear_interpol.cpp Trapezoidal_rule/trapezoidal.cpp hotkezakamain.cpp
 - You will need boost libary (boost/random/laplace_distribution.hpp) (because of the laplace distribution random number to get the z position of the random event)
 - You will need at least c++17 version   
 - It was tested with flags: -Wall -Wextra -std=c++17 -O2, with g++ version 9.4.0
 
  The used files in the code:
  	- constant.hpp: only include some used constants (like Hubble constant, etc.)
  	- hotokezakamain.cpp: the main function of the code
  	- hotokezaka.cpp/hotokezaka.hpp: it contain all calculations, this is the base of the code
  	- Linear_interpol: the linear interpolation method
  	- Trapezoidal_rule: trapezoidal integral method
  	
  Other important files:
  	- parameters.txt: contain all input parameters (more details later in this document)
  	- interpolate_table.dat: binary file, contain datas for linear interpolation during time and redshift exchange
  	
****************************************************  
************ The parameter file*********************
****************************************************

Parameter file
  - the name of the parameter and it's value need to separate with tabulator
  List of parameters and their units:
  	- h_scale [kpc]: ISM scale height
  	- r_Sun [kpc]: Solar radius
  	- width [kpc]: Width of the solar circle
  	- simulation_Time [Myr]: Simulation time
  	- rd [kpc]: Radius scale for galaxy mass distribution
  	- r0_rate [number/Myr]: Present-time galactic event rate
  	- sampleDt [Myr]: set the time resolution of the result file
  	- alpha: mixing length parameter
  	- vt [km/s]: typical turbulent velocity
  	- tau [Myr]: mean life of the element
  	- number_of_runs: the number of calculated random examples
  	- rate_function: the used rate function. Currently usable: Wanderman (Wanderman, D. & Piran, T., 2015) and Hopkins (Hopkins, A. M. & Beacom, 2006)
  	- Ni_calc_method: set the method for calculation Ni. Currently usable: Hotokezaka, Measurement, number (for more details see Ni methods part of this readme)
  	- element_initial_prod_ratio: the initial procudcion ratio of the element (compared to U238). only interesting if the Ni calculation method is from measurement
  	- output: optional, you can set the name of the output file
 
Ni methods
There are 3 possible number methods

- Hotokezaka
	This is only a "magic number", 3.9540983606557375e+49, and it based on the answer of Hotokezaka. This is good for the N_Pu
	
- Measurement
	This method based on this equation:
	N_any = (any/238U)_0 * N_238U = (any/238U)_0 * N_pu * 1/(244Pu/238U)_0
	For this method we will need the initial production ratio of the element. 
	The initial production of Pu is 0.4 (based on Hotokezaka paper)
	The number of Pu (N_Pu) is based on the median number density (eq. 3 in Hotokezaka paper):
	N_Pu = <n_i>_m/(rate_density_0 * tau_i * exp(-tau_mix/(2*tau_i)))
	We know the today value of number density from measurements. If we assume that the today value is the median of the number density than N_Pu can be calculated.
- Number
	In this case the N_i value is an input parameter. If you write only a number after Ni_calc_method in the parameter file, N_i will be this value.

*********** The output file******************
*********************************************

Default case, the name of the output file is results.dat
The structure of the file is the following:
	- First line: Times in Myr BP
	- Second line: The median number density calculated from eq 3. in Hotokezaka in kpc^-3
	- Other lines: Random examples
